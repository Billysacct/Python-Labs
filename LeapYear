# Which year do you want to check?
year = int(input())
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

#e.g. The year 2000:
#2000 Ã· 4 = 500 (Leap)
#2000 Ã· 100 = 20 (Not Leap)
#2000 Ã· 400 = 5 (Leap!)
#So the year 2000 is a leap year.
#But the year 2100 is not a leap year because:
#2100 Ã· 4 = 525 (Leap)
#2100 Ã· 100 = 21 (Not Leap)
#2100 Ã· 400 = 5.25 (Not Leap)

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
if year % 4 == 0:
  if year % 100 == 0:
    if year % 400 == 0:
      print("Leap year")
    else:
      print("Not leap year")
  else:
    print("Leap year")
